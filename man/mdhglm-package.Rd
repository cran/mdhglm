\title{Multivariate Double Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models}
\description{
This package allows different models for multivariate response variables where each response is assumed to follow
DHGLMs (Lee and Nelder, 2006; Lee, Nelder and Pawitan, 2006, 2016). With DHGLMs, the mean and dispersion parameters for the variance of random effects and residual variance (overdispersion) can
be modeled as random-effect models. Furthermore, the mdhglm package allows various correlation structures among the random effects in
DHGLMs of different response variables. Functions are provided to format and summarize the mdhglm results. The estimates of fixed effects,
random effects and their variances and correlations are calculated.
